description: Drive, inspect and verify this project's web app with web-harness — owned browser sessions in Docker, batched journeys, failure bundles, production smoke, container E2E and scenario reports. Use when reproducing a UI bug, checking that a change works in a real browser, reviewing a layout, or proving a fix before a PR.

# web-harness

This project uses [web-harness](https://github.com/Azeajr/web-harness): an owned dev or
production server plus a browser in a pinned Playwright Docker image, driven by commands that
print JSON. The full guide is `node_modules/@azeajr/web-harness/docs/HARNESS.md`.

## First

1. `pnpm exec web-harness describe --json` — this project's fixtures, state sections, scenarios,
   targets, ports, environment and smoke hooks. Read it instead of guessing.
2. `free -h`, then `pnpm exec web-harness doctor` — Docker, the pinned image, the port, the memory
   budget, version drift and whether evidence is git-ignored. Fix what it reports first.
3. Read the project's own skills and `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` for app-specific journeys.

`pnpm exec web-harness <command> --help` prints that command's usage and runs nothing; read it
rather than guessing flags.

## The loop

```text
start → apply a fixture through the real UI → act through visible controls → observe narrow
state and visible effects → assert a terminal condition → keep the failure bundle → promote the
reproduction into a test → verify the artifact that ships
```

```sh
web-harness start [--fixture NAME] [--target production]   # owned server + browser, seeded
web-harness run batches/journey.js                         # one batched journey, JSON result
web-harness observe '#region' | web-harness state          # narrow reads (state: dev only)
web-harness effect --observe '#saved' --durable --expect change -- click e12
web-harness screenshot LABEL                               # then OPEN the PNG and look at it
web-harness check                                          # faults and off-screen overlays
web-harness check --a11y                                   # plus an accessibility scan
web-harness reload | web-harness restart | web-harness reset
web-harness reconcile                                      # after a batch with an unknown outcome
web-harness promote batches/journey.js --to tests/e2e/journey.spec.ts --title "…"
web-harness stop                                           # always, when done
```

What each proves:

- `start` — the fixture applied through the UI and the page loaded without faults. Not that any
  workflow works.
- `run` — the batch's own `step`s and `assert`s held, and no fault was retained. A batch gets
  `{ step, assert, observe, state, effect, allowFault, expectFault, clock }`.
- `effect` — something watched actually changed (`expect: 'change'`), or nothing did
  (`expect: 'none'`). Catches the click that did nothing.
- `reload` keeps memory and storage; `restart` keeps only what persisted (the durability proof);
  `reset` starts over from the same fixture.
- `check --a11y` — axe rules found nothing at or above the configured impact. Automated rules find
  a subset of problems: a clean scan is not an accessibility audit.

## Evidence rules

- **Zero faults is not completion.** A seeded screenshot or a clean `check` does not show that a
  workflow works. Assert the terminal state the user would see.
- **Look at images.** Opening a PNG with an image-capable tool is inspection; writing one is not.
  A full-page capture omits panes that scroll inside themselves; `screenshot --full-page` names them.
- **Record every attempt**, failed ones included, in the run directory's `review.md`: run IDs,
  the images inspected, the exact terminal state. A rerun of the same batch is another attempt; a
  later pass never erases an earlier failure.
- **Read the failure bundle first.** A failed batch prints its `summary` and a `bundle/` path:
  `index.json`, then `timeline.jsonl`, `network.jsonl`, `console.jsonl`, `aria.yml`,
  `storage.json`, `screenshot.png`. `trace.zip` holds bodies and headers — keep it local.
- **Wait on conditions, never sleeps.** Drive running → terminal transitions so a stale result
  cannot satisfy a wait.
- **Unknown outcome:** if a batch's transport failed, it may have mutated state. Run
  `reconcile` and read what it captured before replaying anything.
- **Promote it.** Exploration is not coverage until it lands as a test: `promote` the batch, run
  the suite (`web-harness e2e`), and add the printed `covers` entry to the scenario.

## Host safety

- One heavy job at a time: a session, `e2e` or `smoke` each run a browser. Check `free -h`
  before starting one. The memory budget refuses a start the host cannot hold; do not reach for
  `--force-resources` to get around it. If refused, stop a listed harness run or another heavy
  workload and retry once. Do not poll for memory or repeatedly rerun `doctor`.
- Use distinct `--session` names and `--port`s for concurrent sessions, and `stop` each one.
- Never run a project's browser suite outside `web-harness e2e` while a session is up.

## Proof boundaries

- The browser is emulated (Chromium, WebKit or Firefox on Linux), not a real phone. Installed-PWA
  behaviour, iOS Safari quirks, locked-phone timers and OS notifications need a real device; they
  are `unsupported` scenarios, never claimed as covered.
- The static server applies `_headers` and SPA fallback like Pages, but runs no Pages Functions.
- `state` exists on the dev target only. On production, assert visible UI or durable storage.

## Before a PR

```sh
web-harness e2e                  # the project's suite in the pinned image
web-harness smoke                # the production build: headers, SW, persistence, offline, update
web-harness scenarios --results e2e-results.json
```
